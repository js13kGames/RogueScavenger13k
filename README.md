# RogueScavenger13k
My entry for 2017 JS13K gamedev compo

Scavenger2D - JS version Based on graphic assets and game design from Unity's "2D Roguelike tutorial" 
https://unity3d.com/es/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial

The Unity's version has a 30Mb size, while I'm trying to pack it into 13K. 
In any case, those 14 video Unity tutorials are great ;)

Moreover, I tried to use no HTML5 Canvas or WebGL magic.
You'll see a lot of "div" containers being printed and moved on screen: classic DHTML, man :)
